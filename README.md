## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Install a database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
- Ensure you have the required permissions to create databases and tables.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shohana-howlader/HotelManagementDatabase.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd HotelManagementDatabase
   ```
3. Import the database schema:
   * Open your database management tool.
   * Execute the SQL scripts provided in the repository to create the necessary tables and relationships. The SQL scripts can usually be found in the `sql` or `scripts` folder.

## Usage
Once the database is set up, you can start performing operations using SQL queries. Here are some example queries to get you started:

```sql
-- Retrieve all guests
SELECT * FROM Guests;

-- Check room availability
SELECT * FROM Rooms WHERE availability = 'Available';

-- Create a new reservation
INSERT INTO Reservations (guest_id, room_id, start_date, end_date)
VALUES (1, 101, '2024-10-22', '2024-10-29');
```

You can find additional example queries in the `examples` folder or documentation provided.

## Database Schema
The database schema includes the following key tables:
* **Guests**: Stores information about hotel guests.
* **Rooms**: Contains details about each room in the hotel.
* **Reservations**: Manages bookings made by guests.
